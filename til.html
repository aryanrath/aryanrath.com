      <h2>Occam's Razor</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>When considering two competing theories or explanations, you should <strong>prefer the simpler one</strong> over the more complex one</li>
        <li>The term razor refers to <strong>distinguishing between two hypotheses either by "shaving away" unnecessary assumptions or cutting apart two similar conclusions</strong>.</li>

      <h2>Lessons of History</h2>
      <p><a href="https://jamesclear.com/book-summaries/lessons-of-history" target="_blank">Summary by James Clear</a></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The imitative majority follows the innovative minority. History is largely the battle of a few minorities, the winner of which is then lauded as the victor by the majority.</li>
        <li>Out of every 100 ideas, 99 will likely be inferior to the traditional alternative it was proposed to replace.</li>
        <li>As time wore on, philosophers became the driving forces behind societal changes rather than the church. And then, eventually science stole that job from philosophy.</li>
        <li>The men who can manage men manage the men who can manage only things and the men who can manage money manage all.</li>
        <li>Liberty is possible when security has been achieved, but until that point you are facing competition. It is only because of competition that we developed the ability to create liberty.</li>
        <li>It is clear that freedom is made possible by boundaries of some sort. If we cross those boundaries, we have chaos not civilization.</li>
        <li>Do not be an optimist or a pessimist. Instead, be a realist. Accept that life is composed of difficulties and delights. The difficulties are a natural price of existence. The delights are goodies you don't necessarily deserve.</li>
        <li>"History is philosophy teaching by examples." -Henry St. John</li>
        <li>When everybody owns everything, nobody takes care of anything.</li>

      <h2>The Right Kind of Stubborn </h2>
      <p><a href="https://paulgraham.com/persistence.html" target="_blank">By Paul Graham</a></p>
      <ul>
        <li>To keep trying things, you have to keep thinking of things to try.</li>
        <li>The way you don't give up is completely different. Instead of merely resisting change, you're driven toward a goal by energy and resilience, through paths discovered by imagination and optimized by judgement.</li>

      <h2>King Oedipus</h2>
      <p><strong>Birth and Prophecy:</strong> Oedipus was born to King Laius and Queen Jocasta of Thebes. A prophecy foretold that Oedipus would kill his father and marry his mother. To prevent this, Laius and Jocasta ordered that their newborn son be abandoned on a mountainside.</p>
      <p><strong>Adoption and Youth:</strong> The infant Oedipus was found and adopted by King Polybus and Queen Merope of Corinth. Unaware of his true parentage, Oedipus grew up believing Polybus and Merope were his biological parents.</p>
      <p><strong>Fulfillment of the Prophecy:</strong> As a young man, Oedipus learned of the prophecy and, believing Polybus and Merope to be his real parents, fled Corinth to avoid fulfilling it. On his journey, he encountered and killed an older man during a confrontation, not knowing the man was his biological father, Laius. Oedipus continued to Thebes, where he solved the riddle of the Sphinx, freeing the city from its curse. As a reward, he was made king and married the widowed queen, Jocasta, his biological mother.</p>
      <p><strong>Discovery and Downfall:</strong> Years later, Thebes was struck by a plague. Oedipus sought to find the cause and learned the truth about his origins. Upon discovering that he had indeed killed his father and married his mother, Jocasta committed suicide, and Oedipus blinded himself in despair.</p>
