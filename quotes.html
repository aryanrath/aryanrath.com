            <li>excellence is the product of intention, effort, and execution — not accident.</li>
          
            <li>most people exist; few truly live.</li>
          
            <li>repetition shapes both learning and action, making accomplishment inevitable.</li>
          
            <li>doing hard things daily builds effortless duty over time.</li>
          
            <li>curiosity is a deeper, more honest guide than doubt.</li>
          
            <li>absence tests love: it kills the small, fans the great.</li>
          
            <li>work from the heart to make a real difference.</li>
          
            <li>argument sharpens truth; avoiding it nurtures myth.</li>
          
            <li>you can’t choose your history, but you control the story you tell about it.</li>
          
            <li>hope is created by collective belief and action.</li>
          
            <li>smart people craft better excuses — but excuses still don't build anything.</li>
          
            <li>greatness doesn’t need consensus — only clarity and resolve.</li>
          
            <li>judgment reveals more about the judge than the judged.</li>
          
            <li>people are vessels for ideas, not masters of them.</li>
          
            <li>accurately blaming doesn’t undo the damage.</li>
          
            <li>suffering early is unnecessary extra suffering.</li>
          
            <li>focusing on what you have multiplies it.</li>
